    <!--  Hello Dr PeterðŸš€ðŸš€
 I appreciate the effort you put into the assignment, I noticed that the design implementation on your website is not identical to the original mockup.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge your hard work and dedication in completing the assignment.
It is evident that you have made significant progress in your understanding of HTML and CSS
and I commend you for your efforts. 

However, it is important to emphasize the importance of attention to detail when it comes to design implementation.
To enhance the learning experience and ensure consistency between the mockup and the final result
it is crucial for your implementation to closely resemble the original design. 
Paying attention to elements such as colors, fonts, spacing, and overall layout will 
help create a seamless transition from the mockup to the final website.

I encourage you to review the original mockup and compare it with your implementation. 
Identify the areas where the design differs and work on aligning your website more closely with the mockup.

Remember, the purpose of this assignment is not just to complete the task but also to enhance your skills and understanding of design implementation.
By striving for accuracy and attention to detail, you will develop a strong foundation in web development.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out. 
I'm here to support you in your learning journey and provide guidance whenever needed.

Thank you for your efforts, and I look forward to seeing your continued growth in web development. -->
